This project was a home task from a position I was applying for. 

The requests were as follow:

Every minute, fetch data from https://api.publicapis.org/random?auth=null and store success/failure attempt log in the table and full payload in the blob.
Create a GET API call to list all logs for specific time period (from/to)
Create a GET API call to fetch a payload from blob for specific log entry.

And also I had to use these tools:

• Azure Function (Cloud/Local)
• Azure Storage (Cloud /Local storage emulator)
a. Table
b. Blob

Since I did not wan't to be associated with an Azure account do to connection strings and such, I made this happen by using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-emulator"> Azure Storage Emulator</a>.

Also, just to be sure if my code does actually what it was intended to do, I used <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer/">Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer</a>.

Also, for the API calls, you can use the browser to check the required data, but I used <a href"https://www.postman.com/"> Postman </a> for it was easier to navigate rather than in a browser.

As for the actual actions and usage for the code, it does what the task description asks of it to do. 

When you launch the applicaction, the console will look like this:

Informing you that the time trigger function is working as it should and also, that there are both API calls available for use.
